  - The [`graphql-js` repository](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) is the most popular public repo of [Facebook's `graphql` Github organization](https://github.com/graphql) in terms of stars. Its star history shows that GraphQL adoption (as measured in stars, an admittedly flawed metric) has been increasing at a surprisingly steady pace since the repo went live.
